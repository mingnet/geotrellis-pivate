/**
 *  Operation to compute a flow direction raster from an elevation raster
 *
 *  The directional encoding is from:
 *    Greenlee,D. D. 1987. "Tile and Vector Processing for Scanned Linework."
 *    Photogrammetric Engineering and Remote Sensing (ISSN 0099-1112),vol. 53,Oct. 1987,p. 1383-1387.
 *
 *  The direction of flow is towards the neighboring cell with the largest drop in elevation. If two
 *  or more cells have the same drop in elevation,their directional values are added together. The
 *  8-bit encoding of the direction preserves the multi-directional property.
 *
 *  Sinks, cells which have no drop in elevation towards any neighbor, have no direction of flow.
