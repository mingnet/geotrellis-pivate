Using Rasters
*************

This document serves as a complete guide to using ``Raster``\ s in
GeoTrellis.

Rendering
=========

Rendering Common Image Formats
------------------------------

At some point, you'll want to output a visual representation of the
tiles you're processing. Likely, that's why you're reading this bit of
documentation. Luckily enough, geotrellis provides some methods which
make the process as painless as possible. Currently, both PNG and JPG
formats are supported.

To begin writing your tiles out as PNGs and JPGs, there are just a few
things to keep in mind. As elsewhere throughout geotrellis, the
functionality in this module is added through implicit class extension.
``import geotrellis.raster._`` will import the necessary methods off of
the core types like ``renderToPng``, and the the types like
``ColorRamp`` and ``ColorMap`` live in ``geotrellis.raster.render``.

**First Steps**

Let's say that the tile you've got is an integer tile and that the
integers in it are all *actually* hex codes for RGBA colors. In this
case, your task is nearly complete. The following code should be
sufficient:

.. code-block:: scala

    import geotrellis.raster._

    // Generate the tile - let's paint it red with #FF0000FF
    // (red = 0xFF or 255; green = 0x00 or 0; blue = 0x00 or 0; and alpha = 0xFF or 255, which is completely opaque)
    val hexColored: IntArrayTile = IntArrayTile.fill(0xFF0000FF, 100, 100)

    // Making a PNG
    val png: Png = hexColored.renderPng

    // JPG variation
    val jpg: Jpg = hexColorsHere.renderJpg

A ``Png`` and ``Jpg`` type represent the ``Array[Byte]`` that is the
binary encoding of the image. You can get to the bytes by calling the
``bytes`` property, e.g. ``png.bytes`` or ``jpg.bytes``. It's useful to
use the bytes directly if you are, say, returning PNG data from a web
service. These image format types also have a ``write`` method that can
be called to write that array of bytes to the file system, therefore
writing out a ``PNG`` or ``JPG`` representation of our ``Tile`` to the
filesystem.

Clearly this won't suffice for the majority of use-cases. In general,
you're more likely to be working on tiles whose cells encode information
having only an incidental relation to human vision. In these cases,
you'll need to tell ``renderPng`` and ``renderJpg`` how the values in
your tile relate to the colors you'd like in your image. To this end,
there are arguments you can provide to the render method which will tell
geotrellis how to color cells for your tile.

ColorRamp
---------

A ColorRamp describes a range of colors that can be used to paint values
of a tile. You can use a built-in color ramp, or construct one with your
own palette with the API described below.

Built-in color ramps
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

GeoTrellis provides built-in color ramps in the ``ColorRamps`` object.
These are provided to ease the transition from developer to
cartographer. However, you need not feel constrained by these and can
use your own color palettes as well. There are many good resources
online for selecting color ramps.

Color Schemes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

|Blue to Orange| |Blue to Red| |Green to Red-Orange| |Green to Orange|

*From left to right*

Blue to Orange
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An 11-step diverging color ramp from blue to gray to orange. The gray
critical class in the middle clearly shows a median or zero value.
Example uses include temperature, climate, elevation, or other color
ranges where it is necessary to distinguish categories with multiple
hues.

Blue to Red
^^^^^^^^^^^

A 10-step diverging color ramp from blue to red. Example uses include
elections and politics, voter swing, climate or temperature, or other
color ranges where it is necessary to distinguish categories with
multiple hues.

Green to Red-Orange
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A 10-step diverging color ramp from green to red-orange. Example uses
include elections and politics, voter swing, climate or temperature, or
other color ranges where it is necessary to distinguish categories with
multiple hues.

Green to Orange
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A 13-step diverging color ramp from green to orange. Example uses
include elevation, relief maps, topography, or other color ranges where
it is necessary to distinguish categories with multiple hues.

Sequential Color Schemes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

|Light to Dark - Sunset| |Light to Dark - Green| |Yellow to Red -
Heatmap| |Blue to Yellow to Red Spectrum - Heatmap| |Dark Red to
Yellow-White - Heatmap| |Light Purple to Dark Purple to White|

*From left to right*

Light to Dark - Sunset
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An 11-step sequential color ramp showing intensity from light to dark.
This color ramp is perfect for showing density where it is critical to
highlight very different values with bold colors at the higher, darker
end of the ramp. Example uses include population density, accessibility,
or ranking.

Light to Dark - Green
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A basic 8-step sequential color ramp showing light to dark in shades of
green. Example uses include density, ordered data, ranking, or any map
where darker colors represent higher data values and lighter colors
represent lower data values, generally.

Yellow to Red - Heatmap
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An 8-step sequential heatmap from yellow to dark red. Great for heatmaps
on a light basemap where the hottest values are more opaque or dark.
Also useful for sequential color ranges where the lowest value is the
median or zero value.

Blue to Yellow to Red Spectrum - Heatmap
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An 11-step heatmap from blue to yellow to red. Great for showing a wide
range of values with clear differences in hue.

Dark Red to Yellow-White - Heatmap
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A 10-step sequential heatmap from dark red to yellow to white. Great for
heatmaps where the hottest values should look more vibrant or intense.

Light Purple to Dark Purple to White
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An 8-step sequential heatmap to show intensity with shades of purple
with white as the "hottest" value. Great for light or gray basemaps, or
where the highest value needs to be called out visually.

Qualitative or Categorical Schemes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

|Bold Lands Use| |Muted Terrain|

*From left to right*

Bold Land Use
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An 8-hue qualitative scheme used to show a clear difference in
categories that are unordered or very different. Example uses include
zoning, land use, land cover, or maps where all categories or groups are
equal in visual strength/magnitude.

Muted Terrain
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An 8-hue qualitative scheme used to show different kinds of map topology
or features. This is generally used to show landforms, terrain, and
topology.

Viridis, Magma, Plasma and Inferno
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The Viridis, Magma, Plasma and Inferno color ramps were developed for matplotlib,
and are incorporated into our default color ramp set. You can read more about
`these color ramps here <https://bids.github.io/colormap/>`.

Custom Color Ramps
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can create your own color ramp with a list of integar values,
constructed using our RBG or RGBA helper objects.

.. code-block:: scala

    val colorRamp =
      ColorRamp(
        RGB(0,255,0),
        RGB(63, 255 ,51),
        RGB(102,255,102),
        RGB(178, 255,102),
        RGB(255,255,0),
        RGB(255,255,51),
        RGB(255,153, 51),
        RGB(255,128,0),
        RGB(255,51,51),
        RGB(255,0,0)
      )

You can also do things like set the number of stops in a gradient
between colors, and set an alpha gradient. This example sets a 100 color
stops that interpolates colors between red and blue, with an alpha value
that starts at totally opaque for the red values, and ends at 0xAA alpha
for blue values:

.. code-block:: scala

    val colorRamp =
          ColorRamp(0xFF0000FF, 0x0000FFFF)
            .stops(100)
            .setAlphaGradient(0xFF, 0xAA)

RGBA vs RGB values
------------------

One way to represent a color is as an RGB hex value, as often seen in
CSS or graphics programs. For example, the color red is represented by
#FF0000 (or, in scala, 0xFF0000).

Internally to GeoTrellis, colors are represented as RGBA values, which
includes a value for transparency. These can be represented with 8
instead of 6 hex characters (with the alpha opacity value being the last
two charcters) such as 0xFF0000FF for opaque red. When using the
programming interface, just be sure to keep the distinction in mind.

You can create RGB and RGBA colors in a variety of ways:

.. code-block:: scala

    import geotrellis.raster.render._

    val color1: Int = RGB(r = 255, g = 170, b = 85)
    val color2: Int = RGBA(0xFF, 0xAA, 0x55, 0xFF)
    val color3: Int = 0xFFAA55FF
    assert(color1 == color2 && color2 == color3)

ColorMap
--------

A ``ColorMap`` is what actually determines how the values of a tile to
colors. It constitutes a mapping between class break values and color
stops, as well as some options that determine how to color raster
values.

ColorMap Options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The options available for a ColorMap are a class boundary type, which
determines how those class break values (one of ``GreaterThan``,
``GreaterThanOrEqualTo``, ``LessThan``, ``LessThanOrEqualTo``, or
``Exact``), an option that defines what color NoData values should be
colored, as well as an option for a "fallback" color, which determines
the color of any value that doesn't fit to the color map. Also, if the
``strict`` option is true, then no fallback color is used, and the code
will throw an exception if a value does not fit the color map. The
default values of these options are:

.. code-block:: scala

    val colorMapDefaultOptions =
      ColorMap.Options(
        classBoundaryType = LessThan,
        noDataColor = 0x00000000, // transparent
        fallbackColor = 0x00000000, // transparent
        strict = false
      )

To examplify the options, let's look at how two different color ramps
will color values.

.. code-block:: scala

    import geotrellis.render._

    // Constructs a ColorMap with default options,
    // and a set of mapped values to color stops.
    val colorMap1 =
      ColorMap(
        Map(
          3.5 -> RGB(0,255,0),
          7.5 -> RGB(63,255,51),
          11.5 -> RGB(102,255,102),
          15.5 -> RGB(178,255,102),
          19.5 -> RGB(255,255,0),
          23.5 -> RGB(255,255,51),
          26.5 -> RGB(255,153,51),
          31.5 -> RGB(255,128,0),
          35.0 -> RGB(255,51,51),
          40.0 -> RGB(255,0,0)
        )
      )

    // The same color map, but this time considering the class boundary type
    // as GreaterThanOrEqualTo, and with a fallback and nodata color.
    val colorMap2 =
      ColorMap(
        Map(
          3.5 -> RGB(0,255,0),
          7.5 -> RGB(63,255,51),
          11.5 -> RGB(102,255,102),
          15.5 -> RGB(178,255,102),
          19.5 -> RGB(255,255,0),
          23.5 -> RGB(255,255,51),
          26.5 -> RGB(255,153,51),
          31.5 -> RGB(255,128,0),
          35.0 -> RGB(255,51,51),
          40.0 -> RGB(255,0,0)
        ),
      ColorMap.Options(
        classBoundaryType = GreaterThanOrEqualTo,
        noDataColor = 0xFFFFFFFF,
        fallbackColor = 0xFFFFFFFF
      )
    )

If we were to use the ``mapDouble`` method of the color maps to find
color values of the following points, we'd see the following:

.. code-block:: scala

    scala> colorMap1.mapDouble(2.0) == RGB(0, 255, 0)
    res1: Boolean = true

    scala> colorMap2.mapDouble(2.0) == 0xFFFFFFFF
    res2: Boolean = true

Because ``colorMap1`` has the ``LessThan`` class boundary type, ``2.0``
will map to the color value of ``3.5``. However, because ``colorMap2``
is based on the ``GreaterThanOrEqualTo`` class boundary type, and
``2.0`` is not greater than or equal to any of the mapped values, it
maps ``2.0`` to the ``fallbackColor``.

.. code-block:: scala

    scala> colorMap1.mapDouble(23.5) == RGB(255,153,51)
    res4: Boolean = true

    scala> colorMap2.mapDouble(23.5) == RGB(255,255,51)
    res5: Boolean = true

If we map a value that is on a class border, we can see that the
``LessThan`` color map maps the to the lowest class break value that our
value is still less than (``26.5``), and for the
``GreaterThanOrEqualTo`` color map, since our value is equal to a class
break value, we return the color associated with that value.

Creating a ColorMap based on Histograms
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

One useful way to create ColorMaps is based on a ``Histogram`` of a
tile. Using a histogram, we can compute the quantile breaks that match
up to the color stops of a ``ColorRamp``, and therefore paint a tile
based on quantiles instead of something like equal intervals. You can
use the ``fromQuantileBreaks`` method to create a ``ColorMap`` from both
a ``Histogram[Int]`` and ``Histogram[Double]``

Here is an example of creating a ``ColorMap`` from a ``ColorRamp`` and a
``Histogram[Int]``, in which we define a ramp from red to blue, set the
number of stops to 10, and convert it to a color map based on quantile
breaks:

.. code-block:: scala

    val tile: Tile = ???

    val colorMap = ColorMap.fromQuantileBreaks(tile.histogram, ColorRamp(0xFF0000FF, 0x0000FFFF).stops(10))

Here is another way to do the same thing, using the
``ColorRamp.toColorMap``:

.. code-block:: scala

    val tile: Tile = ???

    val colorMap: ColorMap =
      ColorRamp(0xFF0000FF, 0x0000FFFF)
        .stops(10)
        .toColorMap(tile.histogram)

PNG and JPG Settings
--------------------

It might be useful to tweak the rendering of images for some use cases.
In light of this fact, both png and jpg expose a ``Settings`` classes
(``geotrellis.raster.render.jpg.Settings`` and
``geotrellis.raster.render.png.Settings``) which provide a means to tune
image encoding.

In general, messing with this just isn't necessary. If you're unsure,
there's a good chance this featureset isn't for you.

PNG Settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^

``png.Settings`` allows you to specify a ``ColorType`` (bit depth and
masks) and a ``Filter``. These can both be read about on the W3
specification and `png Wikipedia
page <'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics'>`__.

JPEG Settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``jpg.Settings`` allow specification of the compressionQuality (a Double
from 0 to 1.0) and whether or not Huffman tables are to be computed on
each run - often referred to as 'optimized' rendering. By default, a
compressionQuality of 0.7 is used and Huffman table optimization is not
used.

Reprojecting
============

Overview
--------

Many core GeoTrellis data types can be reprojected. To reproject a ``Line``:

.. code-block:: scala

    val wm: Line = ...

    val ll: Line = wm.reproject(WebMercator, LatLng)  /* The Line reprojected into LatLng */

To reproject a ``Tile``:

.. code-block:: scala

   val wm: Tile = ...
   val extent: Extent = ....  /* Area covered by the Tile */
   val raster: Raster[Tile] = Raster(wm, extent)  /* A Raster is a "location-aware" Tile */

   val ll: Raster[Tile] = raster.reproject(WebMercator, LatLng)

To reproject an ``Extent``:

.. code-block:: scala

   val wm: Extent = ...

   val ll: Extent = wm.reproject(WebMercator, LatLng)

See the pattern?

A GeoTrellis "layer" (some ``RDD[(K, V)]``) conceptually represents a single, giant piece
of imagery. In this form however it finds itself cut up into individual ``V`` (usually ``Tile``)
and indexed by ``K`` (usually ``SpatialKey``). Is such a giant, cut-up raster still reprojectable?
Certainly:

.. code-block:: scala

   // Recall this common alias:
   //   type TileLayerRDD[K] = RDD[(K, Tile)] with Metadata[TileLayerMetadata[K]]
   val wm: TileLayerRDD[SpatialKey] = ...  /* Result of previous work */
   val layout: LayoutDefinition = ...      /* Size/shape of your new grid */

   val (zoom, ll): (Int, TileLayerRDD[SpatialKey]) = wm.reproject(LatLng, layout)

Let's break down the last line some more:

::

   val (zoom, ll): (Int, TileLayerRDD[SpatialKey]) = wm.reproject(LatLng, layout)
        [1]                                                       [2]     [3]

- [1]: When a ``ZoomedLayoutScheme`` was given instead of a ``LayoutDefinition``, this ``zoom``
  value is the nearest zoom level that the layer was reprojected to. Otherwise, this value
  is ``0``.
- [2]: We only need to provide the target ``CRS`` here, since a ``TileLayerRDD``
  implicitely knows its own projection.
- [3]: Providing a ``LayoutDefinition`` allows us to define the shape of the grid
  that results from the reproject. As an overload, this method can accept a
  ``LayoutScheme`` instead.

You may also have a different formulation if your data source is a giant GeoTiff
on S3, and not a pre-ingested GeoTrellis layer. In that case, you'd have:

.. code-block:: scala

   /* Extract Tiles efficiently from a remote GeoTiff */
   val wm: RDD[(ProjectedExtent, Tile)] = S3GeoTiffRDD.spatial("s3-bucket-name", "your-image.tiff")

   val ll: RDD[(ProjectedExtent, Tile)] = wm.reproject(LatLng)

``.reproject`` here doesn't need a source ``CRS``, since this information is
encoded in each ``ProjectedExtent``.

On Layer Reprojection
---------------------

It's important to note that the resulting RDDs in this last example and the one previous to it are
different. The latter is not keyed, and so doesn't necessarily represent some
original, unified raster. It is not a "layer" in the usual GeoTrellis sense,
and the projection is done per-Tile. With ``TileLayerRDD``, the Tiles were
automatically given buffer pixels during reprojection in order to avoid
artifacts (i.e. seams, dead pixels, etc.).

Futhermore, we can expect the reprojected Tiles in the ``RDD[(ProjectedExtent, Tile)]`` to
be skewed:

.. figure:: ./images/reproject.png

where the border regions of each ``Tile`` are almost certainly patches
of ``NODATA``. This is undesirable but also fixable,
thanks to ``.tileToLayout``:

.. code-block:: scala

   val wm: RDD[(ProjectedExtent, Tile)] = S3GeoTiffRDD.spatial("s3-bucket-name", "your-image.tiff")

   val ll: RDD[(ProjectedExtent, Tile)] = wm.reproject(LatLng)

   /* The value type held within the tiles. Example: `IntCellType` */
   val ct: CellType = ???

   /* The size and shape of your desired grid. */
   val layout: LayoutDefinition = ???

   /* Reorganize your reprojected Tiles into a true grid. */
   val layer: RDD[(SpatialKey, Tile)] = ll.tileToLayout(ct, layout)

``.tileToLayout`` works by recutting each source ``Tile`` into potentially
many target tiles, associating each with a ``SpatialKey``, and merging any
that have matching keys. This merging is what clears out our ``NODATA``.

And now we've returned to a nice keyed Layer! Due to fewer
Spark shuffles, this method technically has better
performance than when we had a ``TileLayerRDD`` to begin with. However,
you will not be freed from potential seams or other image artifacts.

Resampling
==========

Often, when working with raster data, it is useful to change the
resolution, crop the data, transform the data to a different projection,
or to do all of that at once. This all relies on our ability to
resample, which is the act of changing the spatial resolution and layout
of the raster cells, and interpolating the values of the modified cells
from the original cells. For everything there is a price, however, and
changing the resolution of a tile is no exception: there will (almost)
always be a loss of information (or representativeness) when conducting
an operation which changes the number of cells on a tile.

Upsampling vs Downsampling
--------------------------

Intuitively, there are two ways that you might resample a tile. You
might:

1. increase the number of cells
2. decrease the number of cells

Increasing the number of cells produces more information at the cost of
being only probabilistically representative of the underlying data whose
points are being used to generate new values. We can call this
upsampling (because we're increasing the samples for a given
representation of this or that state of affairs). Typically, upsampling
is handled through interpolation of new values based on the old ones.

The opposite, downsampling, involves a loss of information. Fewer points
of data are tasked with representing the same states of affair as the
tile on which the downsampling is carried out. Downsampling is a common
strategy in digital compression.

Aggregate vs Point-Based Resampling
-----------------------------------

In geotrellis, ``ResampleMethod`` is an ADT (through a sealed trait in
``Resample.scala``) which branches into ``PointResampleMethod`` and
``AggregateResampleMethod``. The aggregate methods of resampling are all
suited for downsampling only. For every extra cell created by upsampling
with an ``AggregateResampleMethod``, the resulting tile is **absolutely
certain** to contain a ``NODATA`` cell. This is because for each
additional cell produced in an aggregated resampling of a tile, a
bounding box is generated which determines the output cell's value on
the basis of an aggregate of the data captured within said bounding box.
The more cells produced through resampling, the smaller an aggregate
bounding box. The more cells produced through resampling, the less
likely it is that this box will capture any values to aggregate over.

What we call 'point' resampling doesn't necessarily require a box within
which data is aggregated. Rather, a point is specified for which a value
is calculated on the basis of nearby value(s). Those nearby values may
or may not be weighted by their distance from the point in question.
These methods are suitable for both upsampling and downsampling.

Remember What Your Data Represents
----------------------------------

Along with the formal characteristics of these methods, it is important
to keep in mind the specific character of the data that you're working
with. After all, it doesn't make sense to use a method like ``Bilinear``
resampling if you're dealing primarily with categorical data. In this
instance, your best bet is to choose an aggregate method (and keep in
mind that the values generated don't necessarily mean the same thing as
the data being operated on) or a forgiving (though unsophisticated)
method like ``NearestNeighbor``.

Histograms
==========

It's often useful to derive a histogram from rasters, which represents a
distribution of the values of the raster in a more compact form. In
GeoTrellis, we differentiate between a ``Histogram[Int]``, which represents
the exact counts of integer values, and a ``Histogram[Double]``, which
represents a grouping of values into a discrete number of buckets. These
types are in the ``geotrellis.raster.histogram`` package.

The default implementation of ``Histogram[Int]`` is the
``FastMapHistogram``, developed by Erik Osheim, which utilizes a growable
array structure for keeping track of the values and counts.

The default implementation of ``Histogram[Double]`` is the
``StreamingHistogram``, developed by James McClain and based on the paper
``Ben-Haim, Yael, and Elad Tom-Tov. "A streaming parallel decision tree
algorithm."  The Journal of Machine Learning Research 11 (2010): 849-872.``.

Histograms can give statistics such as min, max, median, mode and median. It
also can derive quantile breaks, as dsecribed in the next section.

Quantile Breaks
---------------

Dividing a histogram distribution into quantile breaks attempts to
classify values into some number of buckets, where the number of values
classified into each bucket are generally equal. This can be useful in
representing the distribution of the values of a raster.

For instance, say we had a tile with mostly values between 1 and 100,
but there were a few values that were 255. We want to color the raster
with 3 values: low values with red, middle values with green, and high
values with blue. In other words, we want to classify each of the raster
values into one of three categories: red, green and blue. One technique,
called equal interval classification, consists of splitting up the range
of values (1 - 255) into the number of equal intervals as target
classifications (3). This would give us a range intervals of 1 - 85 for
red, 86 - 170 for green, and 171 - 255 for blue. This corresponds to
"breaks" values of 85, 170, and 255. Because the values are mostly
between 1 and 100, most of our raster would be colored red. This may not
show the contrast of the dataset that we would like.

Another technique for doing this is called quantile break
classification; this makes use of the quantile breaks we can derive from
our histogram. The quantile breaks will concentrate on making the number
of values per "bin" equal, instead of the range of the interval. With
this method, we might end up seeing breaks more like 15, 75, 255,
depending on the distribution of the values.

For a code example, this is how we would do exactly what we talked
about: color a raster tile into red, green and blue values based on it's
quantile breaks:

.. code-block:: scala

    import geotrellis.raster.histogram._
    import geotrellis.raster.render._

    val tile: Tile = ???  // Some raster tile
    val histogram: Histogram[Int] = tile.histogram

    val colorRamp: ColorRamp =
      ColorRamp(

`Kriging Interpolation <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kriging>`__
=================================================================

These docs are about **Raster** Kriging interpolation.

The process of Kriging interpolation for point interpolation is
explained in the
`geotrellis.vector.interpolation <./vectors.html#kriging-interpolation>`__
package documnetation.

Kriging Methods
---------------

The Kriging methods are largely classified into different types in the
way the mean(mu) and the covariance values of the object are dealt with.

.. code-block:: scala

    // Array of sample points with given data
    val points: Array[PointFeature[Double]] = ...
    /** Supported is also present for
      * val points: Traversable[PointFeature[D]] = ... //where D <% Double
      */

    // The raster extent to be kriged
    val extent = Extent(xMin, yMin, xMax, yMax)
    val cols: Int = ...
    val rows: Int = ...
    val rasterExtent = RasterExtent(extent, cols, rows)

There exist four major kinds of Kriging interpolation techniques,
namely:

Simple Kriging
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: scala

    // Simple kriging, a tile  set with the Kriging prediction per cell is returned
    val sv: Semivariogram = NonLinearSemivariogram(points, 30000, 0, Spherical)

    val krigingVal: Tile = points.simpleKriging(rasterExtent, 5000, sv)

    /**
      * The user can also do Simple Kriging using :
      * points.simpleKriging(rasterExtent)
      * points.simpleKriging(rasterExtent, bandwidth)
      * points.simpleKriging(rasterExtent, Semivariogram)
      * points.simpleKriging(rasterExtent, bandwidth, Semivariogram)
      */

It belong to the class of Simple Spatial Prediction Models.

The simple kriging is based on the assumption that the underlying
stochastic process is entirely *known* and the spatial trend is
constant, viz. the mean and covariance values of the entire
interpolation set is constant (using solely the sample points)

::

    mu(s) = mu              known; s belongs to R
    cov[eps(s), eps(s')]    known; s, s' belongs to R

Ordinary Kriging
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: scala

    // Ordinary kriging, a tile  set with the Kriging prediction per cell is returned
    val sv: Semivariogram = NonLinearSemivariogram(points, 30000, 0, Spherical)

    val krigingVal: Tile = points.ordinaryKriging(rasterExtent, 5000, sv)

    /**
      * The user can also do Ordinary Kriging using :
      * points.ordinaryKriging(rasterExtent)
      * points.ordinaryKriging(rasterExtent, bandwidth)
      * points.ordinaryKriging(rasterExtent, Semivariogram)
      * points.ordinaryKriging(rasterExtent, bandwidth, Semivariogram)
      */

It belong to the class of Simple Spatial Prediction Models.

This method differs from the Simple Kriging appraoch in that, the
constant mean is assumed to be unknown and is estimated within the
model.

::

    mu(s) = mu              unknown; s belongs to R
    cov[eps(s), eps(s')]    known; s, s' belongs to R

Universal Kriging
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: scala

    // Universal kriging, a tile  set with the Kriging prediction per cell is returned
    val attrFunc: (Double, Double) => Array[Double] = {
      (x, y) => Array(x, y, x * x, x * y, y * y)
    }

    val krigingVal: Tile = points.universalKriging(rasterExtent, attrFunc, 50, Spherical)

    /**
      * The user can also do Universal Kriging using :
      * points.universalKriging(rasterExtent)
      * points.universalKriging(rasterExtent, bandwidth)
      * points.universalKriging(rasterExtent, model)
      * points.universalKriging(rasterExtent, bandwidth, model)
      * points.universalKriging(rasterExtent, attrFunc)
      * points.universalKriging(rasterExtent, attrFunc, bandwidth)
      * points.universalKriging(rasterExtent, attrFunc, model)
      * points.universalKriging(rasterExtent, attrFunc, bandwidth, model)
      */

It belongs to the class of General Spatial Prediction Models.

This model allows for explicit variation in the trend function (mean
function) constructed as a linear function of spatial attributes; with
the covariance values assumed to be known. This model computes the
prediction using

For example if:

::

    x(s) = [1, s1, s2, s1 * s1, s2 * s2, s1 * s2]'
    mu(s) = beta0 + beta1*s1 + beta2*s2 + beta3*s1*s1 + beta4*s2*s2 + beta5*s1*s2

Here, the "linear" refers to the linearity in parameters (beta).

::

    mu(s) = x(s)' * beta,   beta unknown; s belongs to R
    cov[eps(s), eps(s')]    known; s, s' belongs to R

Geostatistical Kriging
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: scala

    // Geostatistical kriging, a tile  set with the Kriging prediction per cell is returned
    val attrFunc: (Double, Double) => Array[Double] = {
      (x, y) => Array(x, y, x * x, x * y, y * y)
    }

    val krigingVal: Tile = points.geoKriging(rasterExtent, attrFunc, 50, Spherical)

    /**
      * The user can also do Universal Kriging using :
      * points.geoKriging(rasterExtent)
      * points.geoKriging(rasterExtent, bandwidth)
      * points.geoKriging(rasterExtent, model)
      * points.geoKriging(rasterExtent, bandwidth, model)
      * points.geoKriging(rasterExtent, attrFunc)
      * points.geoKriging(rasterExtent, attrFunc, bandwidth)
      * points.geoKriging(rasterExtent, attrFunc, model)
      * points.geoKriging(rasterExtent, attrFunc, bandwidth, model)
      */

It belong to the class of General Spatial Prediction Models.

This model relaxes the assumption that the covariance is known. Thus,
the beta values and covariances are simultaneously evaluated and is
computationally more intensive.

::

    mu(s) = x(s)' * beta,   beta unknown; s belongs to R
    cov[eps(s), eps(s')]    unknown; s, s' belongs to R

Attribute Functions (Universal, Geostatistical Kriging):
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``attrFunc`` function is the attribute function, which is used for
evaluating non-constant spatial trend structures. Unlike the Simple and
Ordinary Kriging models which rely only on the residual values for
evaluating the spatial structures, the General Spatial Models may be
modelled by the user based on the data (viz. evaluating the beta
variable to be used for interpolation).

In case the user does not specify an attribute function, by default the
function used is a quadratic trend function for ``Point(s1, s2)`` :

``mu(s) = beta0 + beta1*s1 + beta2*s2 + beta3*s1*s1 + beta4*s2*s2 + beta5*s1*s2``

General example of a trend function is :

``mu(s) = beta0 + Sigma[ beta_j * (s1^n_j) * (s2^m_j) ]``

Example to understand the attribute Functions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Consider a problem statement of interpolating the ground water levels of
Venice. It is easy to arrive at the conclusion that it depends on three
major factors; namely, the elevation from the ground, the industries'
water intake, the island's water consumption. First of all, we would
like to map the coordinate system into another coordinate system such
that generation of the relevant attributes becomes easier (please note
that the user may use any method for generating the set of attribute
functions; in this case we have used coordinate transformation before
the actual calculation).

.. code-block:: scala

    val c1: Double = 0.01 * (0.873 * (x - 418) - 0.488 * (y - 458))
    val c2: Double = 0.01 * (0.488 * (x - 418) + 0.873 * (y - 458))

Elevation
^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: scala

    /** Estimate of the elevation's contribution to groundwater level
      * [10 * exp(-c1)]
      */
    val elevation: Double = math.exp(-1 * c1)

Industry draw down (water usage of industry)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    /** Estimate of the industries' contribution to groundwater level
      * exp{ -1.0 * [(1.5)*c1^2 - c2^2]}
      */
    val industryDrawDown: Double = math.exp(-1.5 * c1 * c1 - c2 * c2)

Island draw down (water usage of Venice)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: scala

    /** Estimate of the island's contribution to groundwater level
      * //exp{-1.0 * (sqrt((s1-560)^2 + (s2-390)^2) / 35)^8 }
      */
    val islandDrawDown: Double =
        math.exp(-1 * math.pow(math.sqrt(math.pow(x - 560, 2) + math.pow(y - 390, 2)) / 35, 8))

The Final Attribute Function
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Thus for a ``Point(s1, s2)`` :

``Array(elevation, industryDrawDown, islandDrawDown)`` is the set of
attributes.

In case the intuition for a relevant ``attrFunc`` is not clear; the user
need not supply an ``attrFunc``, by default the following attribute
Function is used :

.. code-block:: scala

    // For a Point(x, y), the set of default attributes is :
    Array(x, y, x * x, x * y, y * y)

The default function would use the data values of the given sample
points and construct a spatial structure trying to mirror the actual
attribute characteristics.
